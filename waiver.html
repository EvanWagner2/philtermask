            <p>I HEREBY ASSUME ALL OF THE RISKS of using The Philter&#153;, a full-face mask personal protective equipment (PPE) device coupled to an already FDA approved medical-device viral filter. (the “Product”), provided by Philter PPE Devices Inc., a New York Corporation (the “Company”), including by way of example and not limitation, any risks that may arise from negligence or carelessness on the part of the persons or entities being released, from dangerous or defective equipment or property owned, maintained, or controlled by them, or because of their possible liability without fault.  I ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCT IS NOT CURRENTLY FDA OR NIOSH APPROVED AS A MEDICAL DEVICE.  I AGREE THAT I AM SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER USING THE PRODUCT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ME.</p>

             <p>I acknowledge that this Waiver and Release of Liability Form will be used by the Company and the Company and the Company’s owners, directors, managers, officers, employees, volunteers, representatives, service providers, agents, sponsors, and volunteers (the “Company Related Parties”) and that it will govern my actions and responsibilities in using the Product.

            <p>I understand that using the Product involves risks, and that these risks may be increased during use depending upon the circumstances and environment of its use. Serious injury or death can result from many causes, including without limitation, user error, mechanical failure, negligent maintenance, defects, and/or contamination.  Injuries could be minor (such as bruises and scratches), major (such as eye and/or skin and/or face injuries, infection, sensitivity and allergic reaction), or catastrophic (such as anaphylactic reaction, unconsciousness, suffocation, head and/or neck and/or body trauma, concussion and/or brain injury, acute exposure to the COVID-19 virus or other infectious or toxic agent, and/or death).  I (FOR MYSELF, MY HEIRS, FAMILY MEMBERS, PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES AND ASSIGNS) UNDERSTAND THESE RISKS, KNOW THAT USE OF THE PRODUCT IS VOLUNTARY, AND I PERSONALLY AND KNOWINGLY ASSUME ALL RISKS AND FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURY OR DEATH, AND OF DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OCCURRING AS A RESULT OF MY USE OF THE PRODUCT. The Company and the Company Related Parties shall not be responsible to the undersigned or any third party for any loss, damage or injury resulting from, or in any way attributable to the operation of, use of, or any failure of the Product.</p>

I hereby WAIVE, and RELEASE RELEASEES from liability for all such claims, causes of action and suits which RELEASORS or any of them now have or may hereafter have. <strong>THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER I NOR MY HEIRS OR ESTATE MAY CLAIM AGAINST RELEASEES ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCT.</strong></p>
